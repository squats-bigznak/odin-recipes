            Now you can make this Southern favorite at home. Full of chocolate and marshmallow goodness! Vanilla extract may be substituted with coconut or mint extract.        </p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul><li>½ cup butter, softened</li>

            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            
            <li>1 egg</li>
            
            <li>1 cup evaporated milk</li>
            
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup marshmallow creme</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a cookie sheet.

            </li>
            <li>To Make Cookie Crusts: In a large mixing bowl, cream together 1/2 cup butter or margarine and white sugar. Add egg, evaporated milk, and vanilla. Mix well. In a separate bowl, mix together flour, salt, cocoa powder, baking soda, and baking powder. Add flour mixture slowly to sugar mixture while stirring. Mix just until all ingredients are combined.</li>
            <li>Drop the dough onto greased cookie sheet by rounded tablespoonfuls. Leave at least 3 inches in between each one; dough will spread as it bakes.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 6 to 8 minutes, until firm when pressed with finger. Allow to cool at least one hour before filling.</li>
            <li>To Make Marshmallow Filling: In a medium mixing bowl, blend together 1/2 cup butter or margarine, confectioners' sugar, flavored extract, and marshmallow creme. Mix until smooth. Assemble pies by spreading 1 to 2 tablespoonfuls of filling on flat side of a cookie crust, then covering filling with flat side of another cookie crust.</li>
